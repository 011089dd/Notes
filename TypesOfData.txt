Major types of Data:
  1. Numerical
  2. Categorical
  3. Ordinal
  
  1. Numerical: represents quantitative measurements. Heights of people, stock prices etc.
        types of Numerical data:
                                1. Discrete data: Integer based. Count of some event.
                                    How many purchaces a customer made in a year, how to many times it flip a "Heads"...
                                2. Continuous data: Infinite number of possible values.
                                    How much time did it take a user to checkout, how much rain fell on a given day...
                                    
  2. Categorical: represents qualitative data. Gender, yes/no, state of residence etc. Has no inherent mathematical meaning.
  
  3. Ordinal: A mixture of numerical and categorical data. Ordinal data has mathematical meaning.
              -Movie ratings on the scale of 1-5.
              -ratings must be 1,2,3,4 or 5. But these values have mathematical meaning.
